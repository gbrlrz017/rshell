-list known bugs: 
	- Pretty bad, last minute issue: During "random" inputted cmds, my program crashes w/
		error message: "make: *** [all] Error 1"
		~ input known to cause this: "&&" and any commands with "||" as a connector
		~ issue not limited to these cases only. (happens often)
		~ Only happens when I run with "make". This doesn't happen when I run with "./a.out"
	- To exit my rshell program, must type "exit" exactly, no white space. 
		~"      exit" or "exit    " or "   exit    " do not work.
	- when entering " ; pwd" runs pwd instead of failing 
		bc '; ' not a command like bash does. 
	- cannot run for loop in my rshell terminal, so cannot run many commands at same time
		~ cannot run "pwd && pwd .....&& pwd" 10000 times
		~ I'm sure if I typed all 10000 commands down then it would work (too inefficient though)
		~ So Did not test this.
	- when I run a command with echo followed by a long output plus a comment afterward, I get a perror
		~ example: "echo will cmd after comment symbol work? # ; pwd"




-summarize project:
	- A basic bash terminal that is able to run any command with any arguments passed that are in ./bin
	- There are a few cases where this program fails (namely those listed above)
	- Code: 
		~ user inputs commands into pseudo-terminal. Input is saved in c++ std::string
		~ Input is then parsed accordingly, using " &&;||" as delimiters
		~ Program then runs for child/parent processes
		~ commands are executed in execvp, which is called during child process
		~ parent process waits for child
		~ Fork is called in a loop so after child exits, the parent continues the looping
		~ Fork is in loop to handle case of multiple args w/connectors && || ;
		~ Entire program is in a while loop, which keeps the "$" prompt going
			to keep receiving user input. 
		~ Program is terminated with input of "exit" (see bugs for this special case)
